Followed this tutorial to build the accelerometer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrI2pCZC8cc

In the compass I show the degrees to where you are pointing and also the directions: north, northeast, south and so on.
I also addedadded the interaction that if you point towards north the background changes color and the phone vibrates.
To make the compass a bit more personal I decided to draw my own in paint.

In the accelerometer the values of X, Y and Z are shown and if the phone is upside down (Z equals about -9.2) a soundclip will be played.
